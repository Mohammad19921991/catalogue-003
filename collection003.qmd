The High Museum of Art (colloquially the High) is the largest museum for visual art in the Southeastern United States. 
Located in Atlanta, Georgia (on Peachtree Street in Midtown, the city's arts district), the High is 312,000 square feet (28,985 m2) and a division of the Woodruff Arts Center.

The High organizes and presents exhibitions of international and national significance alongside its comprehensive collection of more than 18,000 works of art, and is especially known for its 19th- and 20th-century American decorative arts, folk and self-taught art, modern and contemporary art, and photography.[3] A cultural nexus of Atlanta since 1905, it hosts festivals, live performances, public conversations, independent art films, and educational programs year-round.[4] It also features dedicated spaces for children of all ages and their caregivers, an on-site restaurant, and a museum store.[5]

In 2010, it had 509,000 visitors, 95th among world art museums.
